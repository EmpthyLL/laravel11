        <p class="max-w-[750px]">Hi! My name is {{ $name }} and I'm an {{ $job }}  hailing from the beautiful city of Solo, Indonesia. With a rich mix of foreign heritage, my work is deeply influenced by both my Indonesian roots and global perspectives. As a digital artist and photographer, I explore a variety of themes, often blending traditional elements with modern, abstract concepts. I’m passionate about capturing the essence of both urban and natural landscapes through my photography, while my digital art often delves into more imaginative and surreal realms, where I can push the boundaries of creativity.

        I also enjoy sharing my journey with a broader audience. I live stream regularly on Twitch, offering behind-the-scenes looks at my creative process, whether I’m working on a digital painting, editing photos, or even just chatting about art and life. Additionally, I create video content on YouTube, where I dive deeper into my techniques—covering everything from in-depth tutorials on digital illustration to my approaches in photography, all while offering tips for aspiring artists. For me, art is not just a personal expression but a way to connect and inspire others across the world.</p>
